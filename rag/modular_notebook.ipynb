The physics major allows students to specialize in the design of instrumentation used in the scientific measurement process; to experiment with high-speed data acquisition systems; to design and implement computer models and simulations of physical processes; and to study phenomena in astrophysics and gravitational-wave astronomy. The electrical engineering major offers specializations in digital systems, communication and signal processing, and control and instrumentation. The computer engineering major is a specialized degree with emphasis on hardware and software design and integration in computer systems. The computer science major allows students to specialize in data structures and operating systems, scientific computing, artificial intelligence applications, software engineering, mobile programming, robotics, and security. The cybersecurity major has its foundation in computer science and information science, and focuses on the protection of computing systems including hardware, software and data.\\n\\nThe Bachelor of Science in Information Science degree is an applied major intended to address the broad scope of modern business, information, and technology problems. It offers specializations in cybersecurity, software engineering, and data analytics.\\n\\nMinors in physics, computer science, cybersecurity, data science or information science may be arranged to support most majors; this is particularly appropriate for science, mathematics, or business majors as preparation for advanced study or employment.', metadata={'source': '../data/pcse.md', 'start_index': 0}),\n",

Our Master of Science in applied physics and computer science has concentrations in computer science, computer systems engineering and instrumentation, and applied physics that correspond to our undergraduate majors of computer science, computer engineering, and physics. By taking a total of 9-12 graduate credit hours during the senior year and one graduate course during the summer, the MS degree requirements can be completed in the following year. Interested students should talk to their advisor early in their program since course sequencing is critical to success. Enrollment in the program requires a GPA of 3.0 or higher.
